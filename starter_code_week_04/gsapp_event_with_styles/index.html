            <h3>Graphics Project Workshop Day 1</h3>

            <p>6:30 pm <span class="bold"><em>Flat, Deep, and in Between</em></span> <br>Jonathan Jackson, Co-Founder, <a class="neon" href="https://wsdia.com/">We Should Do It All</a></p>

            <p>7:45 pm <span class="bold"><em>When Attitudes Become Form</em></span> <br>JiEun Rim, Associate Design Director, <a class="neon" href="https://2x4.org/">2x4</a></p>

            <p><span class="bold">Graphics Project</span> is an annual series of lectures, discussions, and portfolio reviews exploring the role of graphic design within the field of architecture organized by <span class="bold">Yoonjai Choi</span>.</p>
    
            <p>We examine various methods of visual communication used to convey concepts to both specialist and general audiences. These events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and additional resources are available on the <a class="neon" href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/graphics-project">Graphics Project Webpage</a>.</p>

            <p>Graphics Project Workshops are open to all current GSAPP Students. Both lectures on this date will occur in the same meeting. <a class="neon" href="">Details on day 2 presentations here</a>.</p>
