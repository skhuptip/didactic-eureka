                        <p>In the year 2100, parts of Fresh Kills will already be submerged by the rising sea level, but the fabric barriers we set up years prior will prevent phragmites from taking over the new water edges. On the full moon night of September, when the water reaches its highest level through a combination of the moon and season cycles, a harvest festival will be held at Fresh Kills. Phragmites will be harvested before they can wither and clog up waterways in the winter, while the fabric barriers will be let loose for the night.

                        <p>Throughout the history of Staten Island, water was used as a medium for segregation and oppression. In the present day, New Springville and Heartland Village are new neighborhoods that began to form in the 1980s, following the construction of Staten Island Mall. These neighborhoods and the mall sit along a steep slope high above sea level and redirects their street floodings to older neighborhoods along the northern edge of Staten Island, whose locations within the FEMA’s flood zone already cost them higher insurance rates.
